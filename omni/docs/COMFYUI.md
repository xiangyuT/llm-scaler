# ComfyUI usage

The default Omni image runs upstream ComfyUI on one Intel XPU. Models are not
bundled in the image.

## Start the server

Mount an existing ComfyUI model directory and start ComfyUI directly. This is
the recommended default when the workflow fits in XPU memory:

```bash
IMAGE=intel/llm-scaler-omni:0.2.0-b1
CONTAINER_NAME=comfyui

sudo docker run -itd \
    --privileged \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --network=host \
    --shm-size=64g \
    --name="$CONTAINER_NAME" \
    --workdir=/llm/ComfyUI \
    -v /path/to/comfyui_models:/llm/ComfyUI/models \
    "$IMAGE" \
    python main.py
```

The release image supports Intel Arc B-series/Battlemage GPUs.

The default server is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`. Append
`--listen 0.0.0.0` when remote access is required, and append
`--enable-manager` when the integrated Node Manager is needed.

## DynamicVRAM for memory-constrained workflows

Use the supplied entrypoint only when a workflow has a known or observed XPU
out-of-memory risk:

```bash
/llm/entrypoints/start_comfyui.sh
```

The entrypoint preloads the image's pinned AIMDO native XPU allocator pressure
hook, enables ComfyUI DynamicVRAM and Node Manager, and reserves 4 GiB of XPU
memory. PyTorch retains its native activation cache while AIMDO stages,
unloads, and reloads model weights under physical-memory pressure. This can
avoid OOM failures, but can reduce performance when the workflow already fits
in XPU memory. The reserve can be changed with `OMNI_COMFYUI_RESERVE_VRAM_GB`
when required by a specific workload.

Additional ComfyUI arguments are forwarded by the entrypoint. For example:

```bash
/llm/entrypoints/start_comfyui.sh --disable-smart-memory
```

## Models and workflows

Place model files under the standard `/llm/ComfyUI/models` subdirectories used
by their loader nodes. Use the model's official ComfyUI documentation for the
exact file names and directory:

- [ComfyUI documentation](https://docs.comfy.org/)
- [ComfyUI Template Browser](https://docs.comfy.org/interface/features/template)
- [ComfyUI model tutorials](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials)

The focused image deliberately does not copy `omni/workflows` or
`omni/example_inputs`. This prevents stale workflow snapshots from replacing
maintained upstream templates.

## Included custom nodes

The focused image installs pinned revisions of:

- ComfyUI Manager;
- VideoHelperSuite;
- Easy-Use;
- KJNodes;
- CacheDiT;
- ComfyUI-GGUF-XPU;
- ComfyUI-nunchaku-XPU;
- ControlNet auxiliary nodes;
- ComfyUI-OmniXPU.

The Dockerfile is the source of truth for exact revisions. Installing or
updating nodes through ComfyUI Manager changes the running container and is
not part of the reproducible image build.

## Omni XPU switches

ComfyUI-OmniXPU adapters are enabled by default and fall back to the original
ComfyUI path when a capability or input is unsupported. Common switches are:

```bash
OMNIXPU_ENABLE=0
OMNIXPU_ATTENTION=0
OMNIXPU_NORM=0
OMNIXPU_FP8_GEMM=0
OMNIXPU_INT8_FFN=0
```

See [ComfyUI-OmniXPU](../ComfyUI-OmniXPU/README.md) for adapter behavior,
diagnostics, and opt-in legacy workarounds.

## Outputs

Mount `/llm/ComfyUI/output` when generated files must survive container
removal:

```bash
-v /path/to/comfyui_output:/llm/ComfyUI/output
```

Input files can similarly be mounted at `/llm/ComfyUI/input`.
