# ComfyUI-OmniXPU

Thin Intel XPU integration for upstream ComfyUI.

The runtime is deliberately split into three layers:

1. `omni_xpu_kernel` supplies native XPU kernels.
2. `comfy_kitchen` owns generic operator APIs, capability checks, dispatch,
   and safe eager fallback.
3. `ComfyUI-OmniXPU` only adapts ComfyUI call sites that do not yet expose a
   Kitchen entry point, plus a small set of opt-in legacy correctness fixes.

No workflow or model-pipeline replacement is required.

## Ownership

| Layer | Current responsibility |
|---|---|
| Kitchen XPU backend | INT8/QTensor operations, FP8 QDQ and stochastic rounding, SVDQuant, AdaLN, four RoPE APIs, and ConvRot |
| ComfyUI adapter | Attention routing, LayerNorm/RMSNorm class integration, the remaining FP8 model/factory bridge, and fused Lumina/Z-Image INT8 FFN wiring |
| Memory adapter | Cached whole-LoRA model budgets plus optional DynamicVRAM per-layer XPU staging measurements |
| Qwen Image 2.1 cache | XPU slot selection, patch-safe prefix reuse, and pinned host cache data |
| SeedVR2 capacity | Guarded Ada broadcast plus byte-bounded RMSNorm, SwiGLU, and window-attention materialization |
| SeedVR2 native adapters | Validated BMG FP16 GroupNorm and causal-prefix cat-pad routing |
| Large-video preprocessing | Source-guarded, bounded CPU materialization for PIL Lanczos resize, SeedVR input padding, and XPU VAE input staging |
| Legacy fix | Global `F.interpolate` and `torch.median`/`torch.nanmedian` workarounds; disabled by default |

RoPE, generic INT8 linear dispatch, and the old FP8 negative-zero wrapper are
not registered by this custom node. Duplicating those registrations here can
override Kitchen's constraints and fallback policy.

ComfyUI's quantized-format eligibility recognizes `int8_tensorwise` when the
active Kitchen XPU backend provides its native INT8 and ConvRot operations.
Model requests for full-precision matrix multiplication still apply. Other
quantized formats retain ComfyUI's own eligibility decisions.

## Install

The node is bundled with the `llm-scaler-omni` ComfyUI image. It requires:

- an `omni_xpu_kernel` wheel built for the active XPU target and Torch minor;
- the official `comfy-kitchen` and `comfy-aimdo` distributions;
- matching `comfy-kitchen-xpu-runtime` and `comfy-aimdo-xpu-runtime`
  provider wheels;
- upstream ComfyUI.

If an Intel XPU is unavailable, initialization is skipped.

## Official packages and XPU providers

The private AIMDO memory compiler uses an opt-in runtime adapter and leaves
ComfyUI's tracked files unchanged. Build a sidecar-capable AIMDO revision with
`AIMDO_XPU_BUILD_NATIVE_OWNER_DIAGNOSTIC=1`, then start with
`AIMDO_XPU_NATIVE_OWNER_DIAGNOSTIC=1`. llm-scaler checks the supported Torch
release, currently `2.14.0+xpu`, before building or enabling this integration.
After compilation and before packaging, the build also checks that the sidecar's
exported Torch release matches both installed Torch and the provider's declared
release. This check does not install the allocator. It does not compare Torch
library hashes. Public XPU memory-compiler availability remains disabled.

The adapter owns the XPU graph lifecycle and wraps cast, prefetch and explicit
free-memory boundaries. It calls the original ComfyUI functions for copying,
prefetch queue processing and prompt execution. ComfyUI upgrades can proceed
normally: comments, source locations and unrelated changes are accepted;
local renaming, logging, documentation and optional forwarding arguments are
accepted. Interface removal or incompatible queue/iterate/core and
flag/GC/flush ordering disables the diagnostic before allocator takeover and
reports the specific missing contract. No source or AST hash allowlist is used.
Runtime interface changes detected after takeover stop startup and require a
restart with the diagnostic disabled. The native allocator cannot be unloaded
in place. This is a diagnostic interface contract, not arbitrary-revision or
public memory-compiler qualification.

**Known upgrade limitation — free-memory request consumption.** The diagnostic's
additional process-cache cleanup relies on the prompt worker consuming flags
with `PromptQueue.get_flags(reset=True)`, followed by GC and cache flushing.
The current pinned worker uses `get_flags()` with that default. Source preflight
rejects literal false arguments but does not resolve variables or `**kwargs`:
a future worker change to `get_flags(reset=consume)` where `consume` is false,
or an equivalent parameter expansion, can pass preflight while skipping the
adapter's ConvRot/Hadamard, LUT and oneDNN INT8 cache cleanup. ComfyUI's original
cleanup can still run. Non-consuming flag queries elsewhere remain valid.
This is a limitation of the adapter's upgrade check, not a demonstrated defect
in the current ComfyUI worker. Disable the diagnostic with
`AIMDO_XPU_NATIVE_OWNER_DIAGNOSTIC=0` when upgrading to a worker with changed
flag-consumption semantics until that path is validated. An explicit upstream
cleanup lifecycle callback would remove this dependency; this integration does
not attempt general AST value evaluation. See the
[review discussion](https://github.com/intel/llm-scaler/pull/746#discussion_r4215679453).

The provider distributions use private top-level package names and do not own
any `comfy_kitchen/*` or `comfy_aimdo/*` file. The official packages can
therefore be reinstalled or upgraded without overwriting the XPU runtime.
ComfyUI's launcher and Python entry point are unchanged.

During the normal custom-node prestartup phase, OmniXPU discovers lightweight
provider metadata before importing PyTorch. It verifies the official package
version, exact Torch XPU build, platform and image target, source revision,
source-wheel hash, and every vendored runtime file hash. Kitchen is then routed
only when its canonical package is first imported.

AIMDO takeover additionally requires explicit DynamicVRAM enablement, an
unimported PyTorch runtime on Linux, and an official `comfy_aimdo.control`
module with no device context or allocator. ComfyUI calls official AIMDO init
before custom-node prestartup; on an XPU Torch build that can leave only its
pre-device CUDA DSO state live. OmniXPU permits exactly that reversible state,
calls the official public `deinit()`, and verifies that it returned to a
pristine module before takeover. Any device or allocator state is rejected.
OmniXPU then executes the provider control implementation in that same module
object so the reference imported by ComfyUI remains valid. A reversible
provider failure restores the deinitialized official module. A failure after
provider allocator or native state becomes live stops startup because
allocator ownership cannot be rolled back safely.

Provider routing defaults to `auto` and can be controlled without changing the
launcher:

```bash
OMNIXPU_PROVIDER_BOOTSTRAP=off       # Keep every official runtime
OMNIXPU_PROVIDER_BOOTSTRAP=auto      # Use each compatible XPU provider
OMNIXPU_PROVIDER_BOOTSTRAP=required  # Fail unless both providers activate
```

After an official package upgrade, an incompatible provider is skipped in
`auto` mode instead of being forced into a new API contract. Upgrade the
corresponding provider wheel to restore XPU routing.

The image's Linux provider defaults to `native_hook`, keeping Torch's native
XPU allocator while AIMDO manages DynamicVRAM weights. The standard
`start_comfyui.sh` entrypoint validates the provider, resolves its default and
preloads its exact native library before starting Python. Set
`AIMDO_XPU_ALLOCATOR_MODE=global` to select the Linux pluggable allocator.
Older providers retain their own advertised default.

Native mode requires DynamicVRAM and fails startup if activation fails after
selection; it cannot silently fall back to another memory policy. Direct Python
launchers enabling DynamicVRAM must also prepare the native preload before
startup. Allocator modes do not change the model graph or enable XPU memory
compilation.

AIMDO memory compilation (recording and replaying allocation graphs) is
not yet supported on XPU. Its basic APIs and DynamicVRAM model-weight
offloading remain available. This limitation does not disable OmniXPU's
`torch.compile` support.

## Components and switches

Adapters are enabled by default and always retain the original ComfyUI route
for unsupported inputs:

```bash
OMNIXPU_ENABLE=0            # Disable every custom-node component
OMNIXPU_ATTENTION=0         # Disable the attention adapter
OMNIXPU_SPARSE_ATTENTION=0  # Disable XPU eligibility for Model Sparse Attention
OMNIXPU_NORM=0              # Disable the norm adapter
OMNIXPU_FP8_GEMM=0          # Disable the temporary FP8 model/factory adapter
OMNIXPU_QUANTIZED_MATMUL=0  # Disable native INT8 model-format eligibility
OMNIXPU_INT8_FFN=0          # Disable fused Lumina/Z-Image INT8 FFN wiring
OMNIXPU_DYNAMIC_VRAM_BOUNDARY_TRIM=0  # Disable Windows XPU model-boundary trim
OMNIXPU_LORA_MEMORY=0       # Disable cached whole-LoRA budgets and staging logs
OMNIXPU_QWEN_IMAGE21_CACHE=0 # Disable Qwen Image 2.1 cache compatibility adapter
OMNIXPU_SEEDVR_ADA_RESHAPE=0  # Disable the guarded SeedVR2 Ada reshape patch
OMNIXPU_SEEDVR_CAPACITY=0     # Disable bounded SeedVR2 activation scheduling
OMNIXPU_SEEDVR_CAT_PAD=0      # Disable validated BMG causal-prefix cat-pad routing
OMNIXPU_LARGE_VIDEO_PREPROCESS=0  # Disable bounded large-video CPU preprocessing
```

On Windows XPU, the boundary trim turns an unmet DynamicVRAM minimum-memory
budget into an explicit partial VBAR reclaim before model loading. It preserves
loaded models and is enabled by default; the environment variable above is the
A/B-test escape hatch.

Validated sub-routes can be disabled independently:

```bash
OMNI_ATTN_BACKEND=auto      # auto, cute, esimd, or torch; Windows defaults to torch
OMNIXPU_NONCONTIG_RMSNORM=0
OMNIXPU_H120_RMSNORM=0
OMNIXPU_KREA2_RMSNORM=0
OMNIXPU_SEEDVR_GROUPNORM=0
OMNIXPU_EXPERIMENTAL_QWEN21_CACHE_COPY=0  # Disable only the Qwen cache-hit copy route
```

On Windows, CUTE is never selected implicitly. A wheel built explicitly with
`OMNI_XPU_REQUIRE_CUTE=1` still uses PyTorch SDPA by default; set
`OMNI_ATTN_BACKEND=cute` before launching ComfyUI to enable the CUTE routes.

For diagnostics, the per-call CUTE output scan can be enabled explicitly. It
is disabled by default because validated CUTE routes accumulate in FP32 and a
full output scan adds a shape-proportional temporary allocation. Explicit
ESIMD FP16 routing retains its overflow scan regardless of this setting.

```bash
OMNIXPU_VALIDATE_ATTENTION_OUTPUT=1
```

The two global workarounds are opt-in:

```bash
OMNIXPU_INTERPOLATE_FIX=1
OMNIXPU_MEDIAN_FIX=1
OMNIXPU_MEDIAN_STRICT_INDICES=1
```

`OMNIXPU_MEDIAN_STRICT_INDICES=1` reproduces the exact tie-break indices. The
median workaround was only verified on BMG with Torch 2.10 and remains
disabled by default on other configurations.

## Model Sparse Attention

Use the upstream **Model Sparse Attention** node (`BlockSparseAttention`)
with a matching complete native sparse API for SOL, SLA and VSA on XPU. Its
generic Sol/SLA path and MiniMax-H3 chunked producer call Kitchen's public APIs. The upstream node owns block selection,
4096-token projection chunks, previous-step statistics, VSA tiling and cleanup.
The adapter only extends its device eligibility checks. An unavailable native
API or an unsupported upstream eligibility contract leaves the original node
behavior in place.

See [native sparse attention usage](../docs/SPARSE_ATTENTION.md) for model
connections, trained SLA/VSA recipes, fallback diagnostics and migration from
the deprecated **Patch Sol-Attn** custom node. The old experimental environment
gate is not needed; `OMNIXPU_SPARSE_ATTENTION` controls this adapter.

## Qwen Image 2.1 cache integration

When a compatible ComfyUI includes Qwen Image 2.1, the XPU cache adapter fixes
shared Wan cache slot selection and uses Torch-owned pinned CPU storage for
cache data offloaded from XPU. `--disable-pinned-memory` retains pageable
storage; `--async-offload 2` enables ComfyUI's existing prefetch streams.
Select `cpu` in **Qwen Image 2.1 Cache**, or let `auto` choose host storage.
Quantization scales keep their upstream storage behavior. A pinned allocation
OOM falls back to pageable storage; other runtime errors remain visible.
ComfyUI 0.39's `evict_active=False` policy is retained on that fallback,
and older cache methods without this argument remain supported.

On a known BMG XPU cache hit, the guarded prefix K/V copy route is enabled
by default. It falls back to ComfyUI's original concatenation path for unsupported
shapes, layouts, patches, devices, or compilation. Set
`OMNIXPU_EXPERIMENTAL_QWEN21_CACHE_COPY=0` before startup to disable only this
copy route while retaining the cache compatibility and pinned-memory fixes.
ComfyUI 0.39 attention containers are consumed once on both routes, with
the model's preferred attention selection passed through unchanged.

The BMG versioned attention routes include Torch 2.14 alongside 2.11–2.13.
This covers the existing native FP16 H3 VideoVAE D64 route for batches 1–4;
unsupported shapes and other unqualified target/version pairs retain fallback.

A ModelPatcher diffusion wrapper clears and bypasses prefix caching while
`post_input`, `attn1_patch`, `single_block`, or block replacements are active.
Normal caching resumes with empty slots after that path, including exceptions.
Non-XPU calls retain upstream behavior. Missing or incompatible Qwen Image 2.1
interfaces leave the adapter unapplied and are reported in OmniXPU Status.
This adapter does not add the model, its weights, or a ComfyUI version upgrade.

## Resident XPU execution graphs (experimental)

Insert **OmniXPU Graph (experimental)** between the model loader/model patches
and the sampler to opt in. The first path targets native UNet and NextDiT
FP16/BF16/FP32 models with fixed inputs and completely resident weights.
Both enabled and disabled node modes create a non-dynamic model clone;
service-wide text/VAE DynamicVRAM stays selected independently. Disabled mode
provides a matched resident eager reference. Existing workflows without this
node retain their current behavior.

Public diffusion-model and sampler wrappers manage execution. Real sampler
forwards provide warmup on the capture stream. Graphs live for one sampler
call and close before model cleanup, including cancellation and exceptions.
Outputs are independent snapshots. Dynamic prefetch, quantized parameters,
extra forward patches/wrappers, compile combinations, explicit ESIMD and the
private allocation compiler combination use eager and report a reason. The
allocator must use native Torch caching or AIMDO native_hook.
Set OMNIXPU_XPU_GRAPH=0 to disable the feature.

Native NextDiT position encoding uses CPU FP64 on devices without FP64.
The node uses a public model object patch to retain those position constants
from real warmup forwards, keeping the original math outside capture. This
does not cache text features or change RoPE precision. Constants belong to
the sampler runtime; changing shapes, scalar position options or embedding
configuration creates a new graph key. Tensor-valued position options use
eager. Static input layouts must survive cloning unchanged.
Set OMNIXPU_XPU_GRAPH_DEBUG=1 to log capture failure locations.

Connect the optional image input on OmniXPU Status to the decoded output to
report execution-graph counts after sampling. Replay counters are separate
from eager operator routing counts. Interface availability does not establish
model/device support or performance benefit; clean-image and performance
qualification remain separate.

## Native compiled inference

Upstream `TorchCompileModel` clones the diffusion model with
`disable_dynamic=True`. That clone does not disable service-wide DynamicVRAM
for text encoding or VAE execution. Match the service memory mode and model
cloning when comparing eager and compiled performance; use ComfyUI's separate
`--disable-dynamic-vram` option when explicitly selecting a service without
DynamicVRAM.

Compiled FP16/BF16 pointwise operations can round differently from eager even
when each native operator matches. See the kernel package's
[compiled-inference guidance](../omni_xpu_kernel/README.md#compiled-inference).
On an installed Torch build that supports the option,
`TORCHINDUCTOR_EMULATE_PRECISION_CASTS=1` before ComfyUI startup selects eager
precision emulation for that process. This is an explicit numerical policy to
validate for the model, not a default enabled by OmniXPU.

## Debugging and diagnostics

Kernel-only tracing:

```bash
OMNIXPU_DEBUG=1 python main.py
```

Dispatch decisions and fallback reasons:

```bash
OMNIXPU_DEBUG_VERBOSE=1 python main.py
```

LoRA weights are measured once when the LoRA node executes. Unique tensor sizes
are cached in a `ModelPatcher` attachment, inherited by clones, accumulated for
stacked LoRAs, and added to both `memory_required` and an explicitly supplied
`minimum_memory_required`. The base model's `model_size()` semantics stay
unchanged. Model loads read the cached attachment instead of rescanning patches.
DynamicVRAM layer scanning is disabled by default. To diagnose every LoRA
staging operation, including its XPU state and any failure, enable:

```bash
OMNIXPU_LORA_MEMORY_TRACE=1 python main.py
```

LoRA memory logs report `xpu_memory=available`, `partial`, or `unavailable`
for the diagnostic snapshot, not GPU availability. Allocator counters and
device free/total memory are queried independently; successful values remain
visible if another query fails. Missing values are listed rather than reported
as zero, and query errors include the interface, exception type and message.
Statistics failures do not change LoRA budgets or interrupt model loading.

Set tracing variables before startup. The **OmniXPU Status** node reports:

- GPU and `omni_xpu_kernel` capabilities;
- runtime-provider activation, skip, and rejection reasons;
- each component's kind (`adapter`, `compatibility_patch`, or `legacy_fix`)
  and apply status;
- attention and fused INT8 FFN routing counters.

Attention, INT8 FFN and H3 RMS modulation counters record eager calls. During `torch.compile`,
these diagnostic counters and logs are excluded from tracing so changing a
counter cannot cause recompilation. Use the Torch profiler's operator events
to inspect compiled native calls.

Kitchen backend ownership can be inspected independently:

```bash
python -c 'import comfy_kitchen as ck; print(ck.list_backends()["xpu"])'
```
